## My laptop run linux but still need windows

Although I am not using windows in development and other daily job. I still
need to be able to use windows some times. But I don't want to pay for the
windows. And I don't want to use some cracked windows that may contains virus
or other malware.

## Install a official VM legally

This [site](http://www.modern.ie/en-us/virtualization-tools#downloads) provide
VM images for windows OS, for testing the IE. So I download the windows OS here
and don't have to worry too much about the virus or malware problems.
